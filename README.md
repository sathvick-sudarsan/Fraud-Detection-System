# Intelligent Shipping Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project implements an advanced fraud detection system for logistics companies like FedEx. It uses machine learning and graph-based algorithms to identify suspicious shipping activities, helping to prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust.

## Business Case
Just as banks fight credit card fraud, logistics companies face shipping fraud: fake accounts, identity theft to reroute packages, false claims, etc. Such fraud can cost millions in losses and damage customer trust. This system automatically detects and flags fraudulent activities in digital platforms (e.g., account sign-ups, shipment orders, online transactions).

## Features
- **Multi-source data monitoring**: Analyzes new customer accounts, shipment reroute requests, unusual volume from certain accounts, payment transactions, etc.
- **Advanced feature engineering**: Extracts patterns like number of accounts per IP, frequency of reroute requests, mismatch between shipment origin and user location, etc.
- **Hybrid ML approach**: Combines unsupervised learning (to detect outliers) and supervised models (trained on known fraud cases)
- **Graph-based analysis**: Links accounts, addresses, and device fingerprints to find organized fraud rings
- **Real-time detection**: Flags suspicious activities as they occur
- **Self-learning system**: Continuously improves based on feedback

## Technical Architecture
- **Data Processing**: Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric
- **Graph Analysis**: NetworkX
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS (Lambda, S3, SageMaker, SNS/SQS)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment: 
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the notebooks or scripts as needed

## Innovation
This system goes beyond traditional rule-based fraud detection by using advanced AI techniques:
- Graph neural networks to identify complex fraud rings
- Reinforcement learning to adapt thresholds and reduce false positives
- Global intelligence integration for cross-company fraud patterns

## Scalability
The architecture is designed to handle millions of events daily and can be scaled to global operations using AWS auto-scaling and distributed processing. The containerized approach allows for easy deployment across different environments.
